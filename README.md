# üîê Lab 1: Cryptographic Attacks - Brute Force and Traffic Analysis  
**Author:** Raja Muhammad Haiqal Shah

## üìå Objective

In this lab, we aim to explore and exploit common vulnerabilities in widely-used network protocols. The key focus will be on understanding the security weaknesses of FTP, TELNET, SSH, and HTTP login interfaces. Through hands-on attacks and traffic analysis, we will:

- **Perform Brute Force Attacks** on FTP, TELNET, SSH, and HTTP login interfaces to identify weak passwords and unauthorized access.
- **Crack Credentials** to gain access to systems and analyze network traffic to uncover sensitive data.
- **Differentiate Between Secure and Insecure Protocols**, evaluating how encryption and security measures impact data protection.
- **Recommend Mitigation Strategies** to enhance the security of these protocols and prevent common vulnerabilities.

By the end of this lab, you will gain practical insights into the effectiveness of cryptographic defenses, understand potential attack vectors, and learn how to secure vulnerable network protocols.
